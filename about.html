We are an <b>Italian Calisthenics Team</b> formed by a group of passionate guys that started practicing this sport not too long ago. You wonâ€™t find any <b>Hannibal King or Dominik Sky</b> here, as none of us have <i>mastered</i> the sport of Calisthenics, however, we still want to share our <b>passion</b>, to help those interested in being a part of this amazing community of <i>athletes and lifestyle</i>. This is what <b>Lifted</b> is all about: we want to share some <b>basic knowledge</b> for all beginners but also provide information for those who are more <b>advanced</b>. 
Our goal with this website it to make people <b>get out of their beds</b> <i>- see image below -</i> and start working out in order to <i>stay in shape</i> and create a healthy lifestyle through the great sport of <b>Calisthenics</b>. With this idea in mind, the name <b>Lifted</b> and the logo that you see above was born.
