<p>	
	As stated in the <b>HomePage</b>, we are an <b>Italian Calisthenics Team</b>, formed by passioned guys
	that started practicing this Sport not much time ago, but are still going forward and keeping improving themselves.
	None of us is particularly advanced in <b>Calisthenics</b> and you will not find any <b>Hannibal King or Dominik Sky</b> here, 
	but we still want to share our passion and to help more unskilled people. This is exactly the purpose of this website, 
	giving some basic and less basic information, according to our abilities and knowledge.
	We chose <b>"Lifted"</b> as the name of our team because we want to make people get up from their beds and their inactivity, in order to create 
	a passion for this or any other sport in them. For this purpose I created the picture you can see above.
	For any question or advice contact me in the <b>"Contact"</b> section.
