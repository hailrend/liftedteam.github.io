	As stated in the <b>HomePage</b>, we are an <b>Italian Calisthenics Team</b>, formed by some passioned guys
	that started this Sport not so much time ago, but that still go forward and keep improving themselves.
	None of us is particularly advanced in <b>Calisthenics</b>, you will not find any <b>Hannibal King or Dominik Sky</b> here, 
	but we still want to share our passion and to help more unskilled people. This is exactly the purpose of this website, 
	giving some basic and less basic information, according to our abilities and knowledge.
	We chose <b>"Lifted"</b> as the name of our team because we want to make people get up from their beds and their inactivity and make 
	them get passioned about this or any other sport. For this purpose I created the picture you can see above.
	For any question or advice contact me in the <b>"Contact"</b> section.
