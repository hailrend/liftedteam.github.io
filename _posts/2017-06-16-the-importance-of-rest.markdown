<p> <b>Resting</b> is important both if meant as sleeping and if meant as the pause between each <b>set</b>. </p>
<p> In the first case, it is scientifically proved that sleeping 7-8 hours per night isn't only <b>healthy</b>, but fundamental for every <b>sportman</b>. 
	In fact, during these hours our body can recover from the training we did during the day. It is known that an <b>ipertrofic</b> training session causes <i>micro fractures</i>
 	in our <i>muscles' fibers</i>, that need to heal. But, as long as we don't let our body to completely recover from this fractures through <b>sleep</b>, we won't be able to do an 
 	other useful training. So sleeping allows us to recover much faster from our training, in order to be able to do an other session the next days, <b>furthermore</b> it is 
 	healthy for our brain to rest for <i>- at least -</i> 7 hours per night. So, if you want to get <b>bigger</b>, to make your trainings as useful as possible and to <b>lead</b> a 
 	healthy and ordered lifestyle, <strong>SLEEP!</strong> </p>
<p> The other step is resting during your <b>training</b>. In order to do an effective training, you have to follow your workout routine <b>carefully</b> <i>(if created by 
	someone that knows how to set it up in the right way)</i>, paying extreme <b>attention</b> to the pause time between <b>every</b> set. It allows you to recover the necessary <b>breath</b> 
	and strenght to do the following set. As I told above, the <b>aim</b> of every training session, <i>if it is an ipertrofic workout routine</i>, must be to <i>"destroy"</i> our fibers,
	and in order to reach this target we need to take advantage of those breaks to do the highest amount of load we can in every training.</p>
<p> <b><i>An important thing is that during these breaks you DON'T HAVE to waste time and type texts on your phone, but focus on the next set while caring about the breath, every 
	second is fundamental to use all the strenght you have and have recovered.</i></b> </p>
