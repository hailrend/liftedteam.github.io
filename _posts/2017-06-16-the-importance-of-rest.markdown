<p> <b>Resting</b> is extremely important for any sport and it can range from a <i>2 minute break</i> from each set to a <i>7-8 hour long sleep</i>. It’s been scientifically proven that sleeping for 7-8 isn’t only healthy, but <b>fundamental</b> for all athletes and their training regimen. It is during those hours that our body can recover from the training we did during the day. <b>Hypertrophy training</b> (which is a type of training intended for the fastest muscle growth) causes micro fractures within our <i>muscle fibers</i> that need time to heal. If we don't let our body to completely recover from these fractures through sufficient sleep, we <b>won't be able</b> to do any other useful training. Furthermore, <i>at least</i> 7 hours of sleep is essential to maintain a healthy and fully functioning brain. So if you want to gain muscle, make your trainings as useful as possible, and to lead a healthy life, <strong>SLEEP!</strong> </p>
<p> The other step is resting during your <b>training</b>. In order to do an effective training, you have to follow your workout routine <b>carefully</b> <i>(if created by 
	someone that knows how to set it up in the right way)</i>, paying extreme <b>attention</b> to the pause time between <b>every</b> set. It allows you to recover the necessary <b>breath</b> 
	and strenght to do the following set. As I told above, the <b>aim</b> of every training session, <i>if it is an ipertrofic workout routine</i>, must be to <i>"destroy"</i> our fibers,
	and in order to reach this target we need to take advantage of those breaks to do the highest amount of load we can in every training.</p>
<p> <b><i>An important thing is that during these breaks you DON'T HAVE to waste time and type texts on your phone, but focus on the next set while caring about the breath, every 
	second is fundamental to use all the strenght you have and have recovered.</i></b> </p>
